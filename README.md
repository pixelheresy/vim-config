=======================

Installation
------------

- Pull down this repo to .vim [back up your old stuff if needed]
	cd ~
	$ git clone https://github.com/pixelheresy/vim-config.git .vim
- Create a symbolic link for the `.vimrc` to your `$HOME`
	ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
- Enjoy!

This is really just designed for me and aiding in learning `vim`, but feel from
to use this if you like. It will no doubt expand as time goes on.
